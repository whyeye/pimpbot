=DropFolder=

When sticking to a certain workflow, you can build an installer by simply dragging a folder with all your files on top of the PimpBot icon. We called this feature _DropFolder_.

To use _DropFolder_, you must stick to certain sensible defaults. This affects the structure of the data for the installer and naming conventions.

Everything following is inside of _/Name of my Pack_!
