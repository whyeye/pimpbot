Dropbox is a storage application and service operated by Evenflow, Inc. The service enables users to store and sync files online and between computers.[1] Dropbox has a cross-platform client (Windows, Mac and Linux) that enables users to drop any file into a Dropbox folder that is then synced to the web and the users' other computers with the Dropbox client.[2] Files in the Dropbox folder may then be shared with other Dropbox users or accessed from the web. Users may also upload files manually through a web browser.[3]
