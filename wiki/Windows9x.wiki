As of version 4.4.1, PimpBot offers limited support for Windows 95/98/ME. Not working on these operating systems are the "Magic" button to scan presets for required resources, automatic APE detection and the inclusion of files using umlauts (and probably other characters.)

If PimpBot 4 fails to work properly on these operating systems, you _might_ be better off using older PimpBot versions.
